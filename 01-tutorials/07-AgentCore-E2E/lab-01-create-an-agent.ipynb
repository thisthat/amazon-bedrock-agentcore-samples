    "## Lab 1: Creating a simple customer support agent prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) helps you deploying and operating AI agents securely at scale - using any framework and model. It provides you with the capability to move from prototype to production faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this 5-labs tutorial, we will demonstrate the end-to-end journey from prototype to production using a **Customer Support Agent**. For this example we will use [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/latest/), a simple-to-use, code-first framework for building agents and the Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.7 model from Amazon Bedrock. For your application you can use the framework and model of your choice. It's important to note that the concepts covered here can be applied using other frameworks and models as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workshop Journey:**\n",
    "- **Lab 1 (Current)**: Create Agent Prototype - Build a functional customer support agent\n",
    "- **Lab 2**: Enhance with Memory - Add conversation context and personalization\n",
    "- **Lab 3**: Scale with Gateway & Identity - Share tools across agents securely\n",
    "- **Lab 4**: Deploy to Production - Use AgentCore Runtime with observability\n",
    "- **Lab 5**: Build User Interface - Create a customer-facing application\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first lab, we'll build a Customer Support Agent prototype that will evolve throughout the workshop into a production-ready system serving multiple customers with persistent memory, shared tools, and full observability. Our agent will have the following local tools available:\n",
    "- **get_return_policy()** - Get return policy for specific products\n",
    "- **get_product_info()** - Get product information\n",
    "- **web_search()** - Search the web for troubleshooting help\n",
    "- **get_technical_support()** - Search a Bedrock Knowledge Base\n",
    "\n",

    "*Simple prototype running locally. In subsequent labs, we'll migrate this to AgentCore services with shared tools, persistent memory, and production-grade observability.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AWS Account** with appropriate permissions\n",
    "* **Python 3.10+** installed locally\n",
    "* **AWS CLI configured** with credentials\n",
    "* **Anthropic Claude 3.7** enabled on [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html)\n",
    "* **Strands Agents** and other libraries installed in the next cells\n",
    "#### Not using an AWS workshop account? \n",

    "- Built an agent with 3 custom tools (return policy, product info, web search)  \n",
    "- Tested multi-tool interactions and web search capabilities  \n",
    "- Established the foundation for our production journey  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Limitations (We'll fix these!)\n",
    "- **Single user conversation memory** - local conversation session, multiple customers need multiple sessions.\n",
    "- **Conversation history limited to session** - no long term memory or cross session information is available in the conversation.\n",
    "- **Tools reusability** - tools aren't reusable across different agents  \n",
    "- **Running locally only** - not scalable\n",
    "- **Identity** - No user and/or agent identity or access control\n",
    "- **Observability** - Limited observability into agent behavior\n",
    "- **Existing APIs** - No access to existing enterprise APIs for customer data\n",
